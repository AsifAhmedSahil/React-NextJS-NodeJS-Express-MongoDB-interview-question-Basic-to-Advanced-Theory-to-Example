## Expalin React Lifecycle


## What is React Hooks? & What problems do React Hooks solve?
==> React Hooks is a function that lets you use state and other React features without writing a class.React hooks are functions that enable functional components to use state and lifecycle features that were previously only available in class components. 

==> React Hooks solves the problems of sharing the stateful logic between components in a more modular and reusable way than class component.

## How does useState work?
==> The useState Hook enables you to add state to your functional components. It returns a stateful value and a function that can be used to update that value. By using Hooks, you can extract stateful logic from your component
