## What is the fs module in Node.js?

The fs module provides file system-related functionality, such as reading, writing, and manipulating files.

## What is Express.js in Node.js?

Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js that simplifies routing, middleware handling, and HTTP request/response management.

## How do you handle errors in Node.js?

Errors in Node.js can be handled using try-catch blocks for synchronous code or by using callback functions with error arguments or Promises for asynchronous code.

## What is middleware in Express.js?

Middleware is a function that has access to the request, response, and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.

## What is the http module in Node.js?

## What is the difference between __dirname and __filename in Node.js?

__dirname: Represents the directory name of the current module.
__filename: Represents the full path to the current module file.
## What is the process object in Node.js?

## How do you create a simple HTTP server in Node.js?

    res.end();
}).listen(3000);
```
## What are callbacks in Node.js?

Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions and are executed after an asynchronous operation is completed.

## What is require() in Node.js?

require() is used to import modules, JSON files, and local files into a Node.js application.

## What is the buffer module in Node.js?

The buffer module is used to handle binary data directly in memory, especially for I/O operations such as file manipulation or HTTP requests.

## What is npm in Node.js?

npm is the Node Package Manager, a tool for managing dependencies, libraries, and modules in a Node.js project.

## What is asynchronous programming in Node.js?

Asynchronous programming in Node.js allows non-blocking execution by utilizing callbacks, Promises, and async/await.

## What is the cluster module in Node.js?

The cluster module enables the creation of child processes (workers) to handle concurrent operations, taking advantage of multi-core systems.

## What is EventEmitter in Node.js?

EventEmitter is a core Node.js module that allows objects to emit and listen to custom events.

## What is setTimeout() in Node.js?
